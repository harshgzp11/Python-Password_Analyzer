# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python project that checks the strength of a password based on multiple rules.  
This project is built using **functions and modules**, following clean and modular coding practices.

---

## ✨ Features

- Determines password strength: **Weak / Medium / Strong**
- Validates password based on:
  - Minimum length (at least 8 characters)
  - Presence of uppercase letters
  - Presence of lowercase letters
  - Presence of digits
  - Presence of special characters
  - No spaces allowed
- Provides clear **suggestions** to improve weak or medium passwords
- Clean separation of logic and user interaction using modules

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python functions
- Return values and early return
- Helper functions
- Python modules (`import`)
- Conditional statements
- Loops and string processing
- Clean code structure and separation of concerns

## 📂 Project Structure


password_utils.py      # Contains all password validation logic
passwordAnalyzer.py    # Handles user input and output


---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure both files are in the same folder, then run:


python passwordAnalyzer.py

---

## 🧪 Example Output


Enter your password: abc
Password strength: Weak
Suggestions:
- Add an uppercase letter
- Add a digit
- Use a special character
- Increase password length


---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Create a web-based version
* Display a password strength meter
* Allow custom password rules

---

## 📌 Notes

This project was built as part of a structured Python learning roadmap, focusing on **Week 3: Functions and Modules**.
